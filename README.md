### Info 
Hi, I am Evgeny Shmarnev, I'm a Software Engineer at [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/) (ex [GoodData](https://www.gooddata.com/), [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/)), [Docker Community Leader](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Prague-Czech-Republic/) and [Prague Containers Meetup Co-organizer](https://www.meetup.com/Prague-Containers-Meetup/).

I love tea, distributed systems, new technologies, audiobooks and podcasts - not necessarily in that order. I like to learn new things and to teach them. Also I review IT books for [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/). For example - ["Docker in Practice, Second Edition"](https://www.manning.com/books/docker-in-practice-second-edition), ["Microservices in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-in-action?query=microservices)

I currently enjoy working on Kubernetes and Python.

I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me any mistakes.

Thank you.
